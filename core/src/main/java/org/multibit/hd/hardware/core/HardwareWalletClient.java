/**
 * <p>Interface to provide the following to applications:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Common methods available to different hardware wallet devices</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>A hardware wallet client acts as the bridge between the application and the device. It provides a common interface for sending messages
 * to the device, and subscribes to events coming from the device.</p>
 * <p>Blocking implementations will block their thread of execution until a response is received.</p>
 * <p>Hardware wallet clients are tightly coupled to their respective wallet so are typically referenced statically in consuming applications.</p>
